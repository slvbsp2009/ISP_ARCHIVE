/** 
 * @brief Demosaicing using the 5x5 linear method of Malvar et al.
 * @param Output pointer to memory to store the demosaiced image
 * @param Input the input image as a flattened 2D array
 * @param Width, Height the image dimensions
 * @param RedX, RedY the coordinates of the upper-rightmost red pixel
 *
 * Malvar, He, and Cutler considered the design of a high quality linear
 * demosaicing method using 5x5 filters.  The method is essentially the 
 * bilinear demosaicing method that is "gradient-corrected" by adding the
 * Laplacian from another channel.  This enables the method to take 
 * advantage of correlation among the RGB channels.
 *
 * The Input image is a 2D float array of the input RGB values of size 
 * Width*Height in row-major order.  RedX, RedY are the coordinates of the 
 * upper-rightmost red pixel to specify the CFA pattern.
